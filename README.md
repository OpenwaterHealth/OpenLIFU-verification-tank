## Quick Start

### Basic Pressure Measurement
```python
from openlifu_verification import VerificationTank, Hydrophone
from pathlib import Path

# Load hydrophone calibration
hydrophone = Hydrophone(Path("hydrophone_calibrations/your_calibration.txt"))

# Measure pressure at focus
with VerificationTank(frequency=400) as tank:
    # Configure system
    tank.configure_lifu(
        frequency_kHz=400,
        voltage=50,
        duration_msec=1.0,
        interval_msec=100
    )
    
    # Set focus position  
    tank.set_focus(x=0, y=0, z=30)  # mm coordinates
    
    # Capture data
    data = tank.run_capture()
    
    # Convert to calibrated pressure
    sensitivity = hydrophone.get_sensitivity_pa_per_v(400e3)
    pressure_pa = data['A'] * sensitivity
    
    peak_pressure = np.max(pressure_pa)
    print(f"Peak pressure: {peak_pressure:.0f} Pa")
```

### Automated Field Mapping
```python
# 2D beam profile measurement
with VerificationTank() as tank:
    tank.configure_lifu(frequency_kHz=1000, voltage=75, duration_msec=0.5, interval_msec=50)
    
    # Define scan grid
    x_positions = np.linspace(-10, 10, 21)  # Â±10 mm
    y_positions = np.linspace(-10, 10, 21)
    z_focus = 25
    
    # Automated scanning
    pressure_map = np.zeros((len(x_positions), len(y_positions)))
    
    for i, x in enumerate(x_positions):
        for j, y in enumerate(y_positions):
            pressure_map[i, j] = tank.get_peak_voltage(x, y, z_focus)
    
    # Analyze results
    peak_location = np.unravel_index(np.argmax(pressure_map), pressure_map.shape)
    print(f"Peak at ({x_positions[peak_location[0]]:.1f}, {y_positions[peak_location[1]]:.1f}) mm")
```
